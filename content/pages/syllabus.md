## Course Description

This course is an introduction to the physical processes used to measure the properties of plasmas. It will cover diagnostics suitable for a wide range of plasmas, including magnetically confined fusion plasmas and high-energy-density plasmas. Techniques include the measurements of magnetic and electric fields, particle flux, refractive index, emission and scattering of electromagnetic waves, and nuclear diagnostics.

## Problem Sets

There are four problem sets. You may work with your classmates to answer the assignments, but you must submit your own answers with your own wording, figures etc. If you use any sources, you must cite them.

## Exam

The final exam is an open-book exam. Students are asked to summarize and critique a recent paper describing a plasma diagnostic. You may not work with anyone on your answers to the final exam. Your answers must be entirely your own. You may use the class notes, the textbook, or any other written sources, and you must cite any sources used.
